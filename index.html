        <p>I will talk about the gameplay of the tower defense simulator. First you need to put towers so that they kill <img class="zom" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/tower-defense-sim/images/d/d5/NormalFrostEvent.png/revision/latest?cb=20220801052200"/> zombies and protect your base, your base has only 100 hp <img class="hp" src="https://cdn141.picsart.com/312646284445211.png"/> and if a lot of zombies will pass you will lose</p>

        <p>Skincrates in Tower Defense Simulator are items used to for the most part unlock Skins for towers. Skincrates can be bought with <img class="coin" Coins ,        Robux       or event       currencies . Some Skincrates are event-exclusive, such as the Bunny Skincrate and the Spooky Skincrate. This means they cannot be bought after the event has ended. Some Skincrates can be obtained through Daily Rewards, Rewards or Season Passes. The Golden Skincrate also unlocks a           Golden Perk along the Golden skin, which affect multiple parts of the tower, mainly being its stats.</p>
